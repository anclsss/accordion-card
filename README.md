## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Using details and summary tag. Background image positions. Z-index.
This time I started developing mobile-first. And honestly it's easier to later adjust it to desktop with media queries.

### Continued development

Tried to do this as simple as possible. I need to get more comfortable with em and rem and stop using pixels only. But copy-pasting from Figma makes me too lazy to later convert it. I had a delay on this project because I couldn't possibly figure out how to place the images correctly like in the initial design and then remembered the z-index. But then, it moved everything, so putting the images as a div background fixed it and yay - now it works!
Practice makes perfect and eventually I'll get there.

### Useful resources
